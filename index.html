                        A sonic tractor beam that can grab tiny objects and move them around has been
                        created by scientists in Spain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They used the same technology to lift and spin objects in the air using
                        only the forces produced by a field of ultrasonic waves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though not much use for capturing vessels in the vacuum of space, the team at
                        the Public University of Navarre in Pamplona, Spain, hope the technique can be
                        used to operate microsurgical instruments inside patients’ bodies, and
                        direct drugs to damaged tissues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers describe
                        how they used ultrasound to move tiny polystyrene beads measuring only
                        3mm across and weighing a fraction of a gram.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We can move bigger and heavier objects than we have done, but the
                        main application is going smaller to manipulate things inside the
                        human body,” said Asier Marzo, who worked on the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The technology works by using an array of flat speakers to produce
                        acoustic holograms. Just as visual holograms are produced in 3D
                        from interfering light waves, so acoustic holograms are made
                        by interfering sound waves. When the peaks of two waves meet,
                        they produce a greater amplitude; when a peak meets a trough
                        they cancel out.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote><em>We can move bigger and heavier objects than we
                        have done, but the main application is going smaller to
                        manipulate things inside the human body</em>,
                    </blockquote> - Asier Marzo
                    <p>
                        Marzo’s team showed that by carefully adjusting the sound
                        waves, they could create moving acoustic holograms that
                        worked like 3D cages, tweezers or rotating spirals that
                        could lift, grab, spin and nudge tiny particles around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sonic tractor beam uses a 3D hologram with the
                        shape of a cage or bottle in which the object to
                        be moved is captured. The walls of the cage are
                        created by high pressure ultrasound waves, while
                        inside the cage, the pressure is close to zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “When the particle is surrounded by high pressure,
                        it gets trapped there. And we can update the hologram
                        in real time to move the cage towards us, and the
                        particle moves with the trap,” said Marzo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because sound waves can travel through body tissues,
                        the scientists see medical applications as a priority
                        for the technology. “It could be used to manipulate
                        kidney stones, clots, or microsurgical instruments that
                        you control from outside, without having to make any
                        incisions in the patient,” said Marzo. “Or you could
                        hold a drug wherever you wanted to inside a patient,
                        so it doesn’t go anywhere else in the body.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The technology allows for what the scientists call
                        “containerless transportation”, which could find uses
                        in applications where material is dangerous to handle,
                        or at risk of being contaminated
                        by people or machinery.

                    <h2>Iran confirms it will attend international talks over
                        Syria's future</h2>
                    <p>
                        Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and three
                        of his deputies will attend international talks over
                        Syria’s future in Vienna later this week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It will be the first time that Tehran, the main regional
                        backer of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, has attended
                        an international summit on the four-year-long war. Tehran
                        admits that its Revolutionary Guard officers are on the
                        ground in Syria in an advisory role, but denies the presence
                        of any combat troops in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About a dozen participants are expected in total. It was not
                        clear if any invitations had been issued to either the Syrian
                        government or the opposition, though neither side was present
                        at the last talks in Vienna.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a deputy Iranian foreign minister,
                        told Iranian state TV: “We believe the solution for Syria is
                        a political solution. Americans and foreign players in Syria
                        have no choice but to accept the realities in Syria. Assad...
                        has the necessary readiness for talks with insurgents
                        who are committed to a political path.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The talks are an expansion of discussions held last week in
                        Vienna between the US, Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia that
                        did not reach any substantive conclusion. The core talks are
                        to take place in Vienna on Friday, but diplomats expect preparatory
                        or bilateral meetings in the Austrian capital from late on Thursday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Syrian National Coalition, a political opposition group based
                        in Turkey and supported by western powers, said Iran’s participation
                        in the talks would undermine the political process. “Iran has only
                        one project: to keep Assad in power ... they don’t believe in the
                        principle of the talks,” the coalition’s vice-president, Hisham
                        Marwa, told Reuters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tehran’s invitation came after the US declared it was ready to
                        engage with Iran if it might help halt Syria’s civil war. Nearly
                        two years ago, a similar offer for Iran to attend an earlier round
                        of talks in Geneva was hastily rescinded by the UN secretary
                        general, Ban Ki-moon, after fierce opposition from the US, Britain
                        and Syrian opposition groups. But continued bloodshed and diplomatic
                        stalemate have combined with a worsening refugee crisis and recent
                        Russian military intervention to put pressure on the international
                        community to find a fresh approach to ending the war.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Iranian presence is a possible sign that separate talks on
                        Iran’s nuclear programme have succeeded in unlocking some of the
                        most intractable fixed positions in the Middle East.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Russia and Iran say Assad must be part of any transition and that the
                        Syrian people will decide who governs them. The US has said it could
                        tolerate Assad during a short transition period, but that he would
                        then have to exit the political stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All previous international efforts have failed to stop the war,
                        now in its fifth year, with over 250,000 dead and millions
                        displaced by the conflict. Since last month, Russia has launched
                        hundreds of air strikes targeting what it says are Islamic
                        State and other terrorist groups. The Obama administration, Nato
                        and others say most of the bombs are landing on moderate rebel
                        militias, some backed by the CIA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, violence continues to rage between Syria’s rebel groups
                        and Isis, and in the Kurdish region in northern Syria, even drawing
                        in Turkey.
